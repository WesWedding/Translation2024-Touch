# Untitled Translation Submission (Touch + Audio Code)
2024 NWACC SACF Entry w/ Tabitha Darrah

This is the code that drives the Touch and MP3 board in Tabitha Darrah and Weston Wedding's 2024 submission to the NWACC Spring Arts and Culture Festival.  This year's theme is Translation!

The sister project is the [Translation 2024 - Lights](https://github.com/WesWedding/Translation2024-Lights) project, which controls a strand of NeoPixel LEDs.
